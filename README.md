# Iconsur Auto
Automatically set custom icons on macOS, even when the app changes them back 

This very simple script runs [Iconsur](https://github.com/rikumi/iconsur) every time the user logs in to ensure that any custom app icons are kept.

Extremely simple - it took less than five minutes to make - but could be useful for someone else.

## Installation
* Download the script and place in */Users/you/Library/LaunchAgents*
* In theory, it should now run every time you log in. It seems to be working for me over the past few days...but it's also possible that none of my apps have updated 🙈

### **Enjoy!**
