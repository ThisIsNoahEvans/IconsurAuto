# Iconsur Auto
Automatically set custom icons on macOS, even when the app changes them back 

This very simple script runs [Iconsur](https://github.com/rikumi/iconsur) every time the user logs in to ensure that any custom app icons are kept.

Extremely simple - it took less than five minutes to make, I'm not even sure why I've shared it here - but could be useful for someone else.

For sake of time, it simply runs the iconsur exec from my home folder. It's possible to change this for simply `iconsur` if you'd like on your Mac.

## Installation
* Download the script and place in */Users/you/Library/LaunchAgents*
* In theory, it should now run every time you log in. It seems to be working for me over the past few days...but it's also possible that none of my apps have updated ðŸ™ˆ

### **Enjoy!**
